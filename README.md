## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical **S&P 500 stock price data (2014–2017)** to evaluate market performance, volatility, risk exposure, and stock-level returns using **SQL, Power BI, and DAX**.

The dashboard provides:

- Market growth trends over time  
- Cumulative return analysis  
- 30-day rolling volatility measurement  
- Maximum drawdown tracking  
- Top-performing stock identification  
- Risk vs return insights  

This project demonstrates practical skills in **data modeling, time-series analysis, financial KPIs, and business intelligence reporting**.
